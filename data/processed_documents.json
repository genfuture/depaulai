DePaul engages in a holistic review of applicants and the test-optional alternative allows us to consider your strengths that may be demonstrated in areas other than your ACT or SAT score. Both our internal and external research show that your high school record, in particular your grades in challenging core subjects, is the most important academic component in the review for admission. By allowing you to determine how to best showcase your academic performance, DePaul is emphasizing that four years of perseverance, motivation and effort during high school bear a direct relationship to successful college-level work. 2.

Today, Professor Aguirres specimens shed new light on the evolutionary history of freshwater fishes. His research gives students a greater perspective on biology and the world around them. In April 2012, a new species of suckermouth armored catfish was announced in National Geographica discovery made by Windsor Aguirre, assistant professor, Department of Biological Sciences. As a field researcher, Aguirre explores how fish species work in nature, how they differ based on ecological preferences, and how theyve evolved. Im asking pretty fundamental questions, he says. What factors facilitate or constrain the origin of a species? How do species actually form? In Alaska, hes studying the evolutionary diversification of three-spined stickleback fish.

Discovering new species On a trip to Ecuador in 2008, while collecting specimen in the Santa Rosa River, Aguirre pulled in a few fish he couldnt readily identify. I sent photos to Jon Armbruster, a taxonomist at Auburn University, who eventually determined that we were dealing with a new species, which he namedCordylancistrus santarosensis. Finding a new species was certainly exciting, but in some ways not that surprising this region of the world is so little explored that scientists dont know how many species of fresh water fish exist or how theyre distributed. We dont even know which species of fish occur in which rivers. This particular discovery turned out to be important for a few reasons. First, the species might be a missing",

Im not a catfish specialist, Aguirre explains, but the new species is important biogeographically. Its in a genus that wasnt known to be in this region and its an intermediate between two genera in theory, this specimen provides a little more information about the evolution of suckermouth catfish. Now, specialists have a new piece of a puzzle, and thats always interesting. The new species is yet more evidence of just how much in nature is still unknown.

But thats not true, Aguirre says. New species are discovered every year. A sample is collected, someone describes it, its put in a museum, and thats all we know. For most species, we know nothing more than their names. We dont know what they eat, or how much variability is in their population, or where they fit in the evolutionary tree of life.

Nezih Altaycalled the disaster guy because of his recognized research in humanitarian supply chain managementis looking for a better way to bring relief to devastated places and people. The seed of Nezih Altays interest in humanitarian supply chains was planted in 1999 during a 7.2 earthquake in Istanbul only days before his wedding. Asking the right questions My wife and I were staying with our parents, and we were lucky because our homes did not collapse. But we lived for the next five days, with our wedding guests, in a public park. It took the government 72 hours to establish emergency operations. Afterward, questions stayed with me What took so long? Why isnt disaster relief more effective and efficient?

Given this universality, youd think countries and NGOs would have in place proven policies and procedures. But they dont, really, he says. The process of delivering goodswhich happens commercially everywhere, every daybreaks down because everything thats lacking needs to be brought to the disaster zone from other areas. This creates a temporary, but immense, material convergence in one place. What can be done to fix that? Very little substantive research has been done on that question.

Multiple Problems, No Simple Solution Commercial enterprises prepare for disruptions by making their supply chains resilient, whether by mapping alternative pathways to markets, or prepositioning stock in accessible locations, or running operations from an emergency command center. These strategies require business intelligence and collaboration, and thats the rub for humanitarian supply chains. First of all, humanitarian relief is a political game. Nezih Altay, Associate Professor, Driehaus College of Business A country hit by a disaster has to ask for assistance No one can just show up and say Were here to help. When an earthquake devastated southeastern Iran in 2003, the government refused help from Israel, even though Israel has the worlds best search-and-rescue teams, which could have been on-the-ground immediately.

It was Irans choice to put politics before people. Also, customs laws need to be relaxed so shipments can enter the country quickly, and that can be politically problematic because all kinds of things can cross an open border. Next, the sheer scope-of-need defies organization. Of the two million Syrian refugees in Turkey today, 850,000 are in camps. A camp in Jordan has 800,000 refugees, making it the countrys fourth largest city. No food is grown in a camp no products are made for export. Sanitation is a problem, as is crime, hoarding, looting and other forms of black market opportunism. And some refugee camps never disperse, so a temporary crisis becomes a permanent problem, says Altay. In Haiti 300,000 people still live in camps. One reason is corruption A lot of the 10 billion in aid sent to Haiti never trickled down. Another",

Another reason is that life in the camp is better than it was before In the camp, people are fed and sheltered. Why go back to homelessness? Twenty years ago in Kenya, a camp for 5,000 war refugees from Somalia was set up now 500,000 people live there. A whole generation has been born in, and has never left, that camp. The role of NGOs non-government organizations poses additional challenges. Since theres no certification system for relief work, some NGOs know what theyre doing and some dont. Large NGOswhich get funds from the United Nations Office of Crisis and Humanitarian Assistanceare pressured to spend, fast. So, they subcontract relief work to local, smaller groups which spring up overnight. Again, there are plenty of opportunities for confusion and corruption. Another somewhat surprising problem",

When unsolicited goods are sent by people or companiesusually with good intentions, but sometimes to dump excess inventorythey cause, in the words of one NGO executive, a second disaster No one wants the items, and no one owns the items, but they have to be processed, somehow, anyway. That takes up already scarce resources, costing time and money. Searching for a Better Way Altay calls disaster relief a supply chain on steroids because of the big powers, the big money, and the big pressure to do everything very, very fast. The large number of players creates material convergence and gridlock The governments and relief workers, the NGOs, the military people, the helpful volunteers, all run to the same location, at the same time.

Because they have no natural predators in North America, the carp are virtually impossible to eradicate, according to the National Wildlife Federation, which warns that its crucial to prevent the carp from entering the Great Lakes. When I heard about the carp",

When I heard about the carp something clicked, Cody recalls. Could there be a commercial market for the fish? The carp is actually a tasty, low-fat source of omega-3 proteins, so I tested recipes for an all-natural dog treat using the fish as the main ingredient. My dogs loved it! Now, as the CEO of BareItAll PetFoods, Cody expects to use thousands of pounds of carp each month as the business takes off. Because I was in the program, a lot of ideas fell into place, he says. I was drawn to DePaul because its entrepreneurial approach is ranked among the top in the world. Plus, the sustainability focus was a natural fit for me. The program prepared me to be innovative, to open a business, and to run a businessall in pursuit of work I valued and could believe in. Teaching Students How to Bring About Change Our students",

Andy Chae BA, 13 was in the right place, at the right time, when DePaul launched the urban agriculture program. I was interested in urban farming, but knew it would be a hard way to make a living, he says. At DePaul I found a real business model for urban farming, one built on the three pillars of sustainability the environment, the community, and the economy. I was able to experiment without risk, and my teachers gave me confidence that I could actually succeed. As an undergrad, Chae helped start the DePaul Urban Farming Organization, which he says encouraged his environmental activism",

Through these experiences, I learned to take a professional approach to urban farming, he says. And I began to see that urban farming is a way to revitalize a city. DePaul students focused on sustainability are succeeding in the real world because they take the long view They know that change is a slow, but rewarding, process.

When Rob Buelow BA 11 was an undergraduate, he spent time working as a manager at Middlebury Farms, a 20-acre, community-supported organic farm in Barrington, IL. This experience, coupled with my classwork, really sparked my interest in urban farming, he says. Now, Buelow works for Gordon Food Service, a broad line food distributor which is trying to bring the principles of sustainability to its part of the industry.

With grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA, the associate professor of Industrial and Organizational Psychology is studying team composition for a mission to Mars. Getting to Mars If one is putting together a team to go to Mars, do some universal principles applythe same as those for any team, in any contextor are the considerations unique? Bell says the answer is both. A mission teamlike any team, anywhereneeds competent people who work well together. In our models, we assume that astronauts are intelligent, that theyre experts in their technical areas, and that they have at least some teamwork skills. Whats tricky is how well individuals combine.

Theyll be isolated and confinedin a space about the size of a studio apartmentfor a long time, an estimated 2¬Ω years. When four people live and work in a small space, day after day, certain combinations of personalities, okay in normal life, could become a problem, Bell says. For example, in a corporate team, a mix of extroverts and introverts can create a balanced give-and-take. But in a mission, a very sociable, talkative person could become irritating and could end up being ostracized. AdDressing the Challenges In 2013, NASA asked Bell for a literature review and operational assessment of team composition issues for long-distance space exploration. Bell was able to include students in this project, one part of which was interviewing astronauts, flight directors, and other stakeholders.

Suzanne Bell, Associate Professor of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, College of Science and Health In July of 2015, Bell started a three-year, 1 million project called CREWS Crew Recommender for Effective Work in Space. She started the project with two researchers from Northwestern University to create an algorithm which helps NASA predict how well different combinations of people would do on a 30-month mission. Over the course of a year, they collected data in the Human Exploration Research Analog HERA at Johnson Space Center in Houston. As part of the research they put teams of four into isolation and confinement for 30 days, asking them to perform specific tasks under varying conditions and assessing to what extent variablessuch as gender,",

Bell explains that they are using what theyve learned to inform the computer simulation, called an agent-based model, which allows them to play out a potential mission with thousands of virtual teams and manipulate reality to predict responses, like How would particular combinations of team members react to different situations? Would those reactions change over time? The final outcome will be a Crew Recommender System. The system will also help NASA identify the problems that are most likely to occur with a chosen crew, and this information could be used to design interventions.

This first-of-its-kind collaboration is important because long-duration space exploration will involve multiple agencies and an international crew no one country can afford to go to Mars on its own, says Bell. Our work will focus on interpersonal relationship formation within crews. Its really a cool project, because our Russian partners look at interpersonal compatibility a little differently. US researchers tend to use a normative approach, looking for attributes and attribute combinations that predict desired outcomes. The Russian researchers focus less on specific traits and, instead, use clever measures that assess interpersonal compatibility. The goal of the project is to integrate",

In 2006, Nicole Pinkard, a former associate professor, Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media, received a 1.6 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation to study how digital media affects literacy. And shes received grants each year since to continue her timely and important work. Technology always makes it possible to communicate in new and different ways, says Pinkard. That was true with the invention of the printing press, and its true today with the emergence of new media.

The digitally literate know how a narrative flows, how it has a beginning, a middle, and an end. In her research on the connections between digital media and literacy, Pinkard recognized the beginning of a new and quickly widening gap between the haves and the have-nots.

I decided to find a solution to that potentially huge problem  and started the Digital Youth Network. Closing the Gap Working with University of Chicago charter schools, the Digital Youth Network brings digital literacy to middle-school and high-school students in two ways. An after-school program allows the students to pursue their interests in particular areas, such as game design, graphic design, music production, or video production. A media arts class, taught by artist practitioners, gives sixth graders basic skills in digital literacy. The students create a record label, including writing lyrics and music, recording songs, making music videos, writing artist profiles, making podcasts, and designing logos.

The students can represent their understanding of books in multiple ways. And they have the repertoire of skills to decide which media is the right choice for a given situation, says Pinkard. Before launching the Digital Youth Network, Pinkard had compared the University of Chicago charter school students with those growing up in Silicon Valley only four percent of beginning sixth graders from the charter schools had equal or more experiences in creating media.

Wright Mills warned us against the blindness of empirical data without theory and the emptiness of theory without data. If we document poor health literacy in a population, but have no theory about the cause, wed have a relatively empty understanding of the problem. Theory frames the right questions and then helps us interpret the data. If data proves a theory wrong, we can come up with a better one.

Interest rates Various interest rates and fees are available from lending institutions. You also should consider what income you can realistically expect in your proposed career. Instead of a flat interest rate that is easy to compare, such as 8 or 10 percent, private loan programs generally have interest rates that are variable. Usually, they are based on either the prime rate or a treasury bill rate, such as the 91-day T-Bill or 13-week T-Bill rate.

With the answers, the company could make rational, informed decisions about investments in specific products and snack categories. At the same time, retailers use big data to decide how much shelf space to allocate to each category. For example, Frito-Lay could use real evidence to show Wal-Mart that the nuts and seeds category was growing and should, therefore, have a larger, more prominent display in the store.

Here, they discuss the journals importance, especially in light of contemporary, global business practices. PaethThe idea of a journal began in conversations between Tom and me while we were editing the book, Religious Perspectives on Business Ethics. We realized that very few academic resources address the inter-relationship of religion, as a field of study, and business ethics.

At the same time, scholars are forced to publish in secular journals, which haveunderstandablya filter. Clearly, these journals cant and wont accept too many religious papers.

People ask me, Can ethics be taught? says Kelly Pope, associate professor in the School of Accountancy. I think the answer is No, but consequences can be shown. And thats what were doing with Crossing The Lineshowing how the guy next door can get into serious ethical trouble on the job. The people weve interviewed and filmed are just like your peers, your neighbors, the people you went to college with, the parents of your kids friends, Pope explains. Really ordinary people, who have committed extraordinary crimes and ended up in prison. Thats why this film is such a great teaching tool. Its not only about theory rather, it shows how easy it is to slip, and then slide, into murky behavior. That creates great classroom conversations.

Rick Salisbury, video producer at DePaul University Open To Interpretation The film is not a documentary in the style of The Smartest Guys in the Room or Inside Job. Rick Salisbury, a video producer with the Driehaus College of Business, explains We deliberately left out a traditional narrator because we wanted to avoid the voice of God perspective, that all-knowing authority. Rather, in the film, people tell their own stories, and those stories are open to interpretation. Because the film is an educational tool, viewers have to decide whether each felon is credible or sympathetic I dont believe that guy or I can see myself in this guy.

Jason Green MSA 13 volunteered to work on the project after seeing the film in an accounting class. I instantly recognized a valuable opportunity to expand my skills as an auditor, he explained. For example, I got a chance to sit down with the former CFO of HealthSouth, Weston Smith, who had helped pull off a 3.6 billion fraud.

Men tend to commit white-collar crimes within a good-old-boy network of chummy business deals, suggests Salisbury. Is accounting crime the same for women? My research suggests not, answers Pope.

Im so lucky, says Bin Jiang, the recipient of a five-year grant enabled by the 30 million donation by Richard H. Driehaus to DePauls business schoolto support the hiring and retention of extraordinary faculty. Certainly, that luck runs both ways, as Jiang has contributed excellent research and teaching to DePauls business school as a professor in the Department of Management. When I was evaluating job offers, I was drawn to DePaul by the opportunity to work with our department chair, Scott Young, and other faculty on the business challenges that intrigue me, especially the complexities, both practical and ethical, in managing global supply chains, says Jiang.

I illustrate the principles of supply chain management with case studies based on my own experiences and those of my business friends still in China. Because Im confident in the content, my students connect to the material better. Case writing is very time consuming, and many schools dont count it as research. So, those teachers are hard-pressed to use cases as a teaching tool. But in law school, students learn by cases. In medical school, they learn by cases. Business school is not an academic education its a professional education.

Outsourcing production Jiang has always been drawn to supply chain management, particularly the role of outsourcing, because of the disciplines central role in modern commerce. Todays competition isnt between company and company, but between supply chain and supply chain. Being a winner means tearing down the walls between companies. As a result, theres a lot of risk in these relationships. For example, when a company outsources part of its production, is the other company a working horse or a Trojan horse? Will the supplier steal the others intellectual property or even its business? This has happened plenty of times. Given that possibility, management has to ask Does outsourcing really increase our companys value? Or is it just a short-term advantage with long-term liabilities? On top of those",

Secondlyand this is importantmedia coverage does not simply march to the drum beat of PR efforts during these elections. So, while sources do influence media content, the relationship between the two is reciprocal. Does one side tend to lead? The answer is neither simple nor absolute.

And the need for improvement is huge, Montague says. In the US, were talking about high costs, lots of issues around patient safety, worker burnout, a shortage of nurses and primary care physicians, and an aging population. In the next few years, the industry is going to have to figure out how to do a lot more with a lot less. Montague also notes that the industry has been slow to adapt to technology to improve work.

I have been teaching at DePaul for 30 years and have benefitted from being in the right place, at the right time The field and I grew up together. Perhaps the aspect I like most about the field is its interdisciplinary nature Teaching it requires some knowledge of art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, international relations and other academic fields. One thing we do well at DePaul College of Law is to look at the big picture. Here, art and cultural heritage law is affiliated with two other areas intellectual property and international law. Both of these programs at DePaul are nationally recognized. As a result, our students graduate with a broad set of practical skills.

The Committee makes recommendations to the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs as to whether the United States should enter into bilateral agreements with other nations to restrict the import into the U.S. of undocumented archaeological and ethnological materials. The legislation under which the Committee operates is part of the United States adherence to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. When this legislation was adopted in 1983, the United States was, and probably still is, the single largest end-destination country for looted antiquities and stolen artifacts.

And can that process be stopped in its tracks? Those questions drive Eric Norstrom in his work at DePaul. A neurobiologist and assistant professor in the College of Science and Health, Norstrom studies the molecular function of amyloid precursor protein APP. While APP plays an important role in normal brain functioning, its interaction with certain other proteins can form beta amyloid peptide, the main component of the brain deposits that characterize Alzheimers disease. Norstrom is looking for these other proteins that cause APP to take a wrong turn. The more we know about that process, the better the odds of manipulating it. By the time Alzheimers presents, theres already been a lot of damage. But if we could detect the process early enough, maybe we could intervene before its too late.

Eric Norstrom, biology professor, DePaul University A lot of scientists do Alzheimers research, so Ive had to puzzle myself into the right niche, Norstrom says. Small labs can focus on novel proteins that a large lab wouldnt attack. Of course, Id love to discover a protein interaction that could bias metabolic pathways and, thereby, slow or cure Alzheimers. But to be a scientist, you have to enjoy the race, not just the finish line. A Passion For TEACHING AND RESEARCH Norstrom joined DePaul after finishing his PhD and post-doctoral research at the University of Chicago, where he worked on Alzheimers and prion diseases, such as mad cow disease, in which a protein aggregates into large, sometimes toxic and infectious structures.

Just ask them. One size fits all cant describe their clothing, music or hairstyles, let alone their experiences. So surely a generic stress reduction program wouldnt fit all either. The life of an African-American child in Chicago is radically different from the life of a white child in Chicago and even of an African-American child in other cities, says DePaul psychology Professor LaVome Robinson. Yes, like other kids they worry about their grades or about their social lives, but the biggest thing they worry about is their safety in the midst of potentially explosive situations.
