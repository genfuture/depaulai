DePaul-sponsored study abroad programs allow you to study off-campus in an approved program through DePaul. This is the most common and often the most affordable study abroad option for DePaul students who are receiving financial aid, as funds apply to these programs.

They pay out-of-pocket directly to the external program. Upon return, students can work with Financial Aid to reinstate their aid.
