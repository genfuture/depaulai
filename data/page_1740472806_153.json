Jackson Blvd.Chicago, IL 60604 Frequently Asked Questions What are the application deadlines for undergraduate returning students? Returning student applications are accepted for every quarter on a rolling basis until the start of the term. We do encourage submitting an application as soon as possible in order to have sufficient time to meet with academic advising and consider financial aid before the start of the quarter. Is there an application fee? No, there is no application fee for returning students. Will I keep my previous financial aid award? A financial aid award is only applicable for the academic year it is intended for, so you will need to submit a new FAFSA application to receive an updated financial aid award. Counselors inOneDePaulcan assist you with this process. I left DePaul with a financial hold. Can I still be readmitted? Yes, you can still be readmitted to DePaul, but you will need to address your financial hold before registering for classes. It's recommended that you be in contact withOneDePaulto discuss any financial holds while applying for readmission. I was academically dismissed from DePaul. How can I be readmitted? A dismissed student can be considered for returning admission after a period or two quarters, excluding summer sessions. Please note that a dismissed student may be required by their college to take courses at another accredited college or university before returning student admission is approved. Students are notified of this at the time of dismissal. You will also be asked to write a statement as part of your readmission application. If you have questions regarding your academic dismissal, please contact your college's academic advising office.
