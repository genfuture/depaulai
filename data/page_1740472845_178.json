Your wages are paid jointly by federal funds and by DePaul. The amount of your federal work-study eligibility is based on your financial need. Participating in Federal Work-Study Work-study wages are paid directly to you for hours worked and are not credited to your tuition account like other aid. Your hourly rate of pay is based on the requirements of your job and on university pay scales, but will not be less than the Chicago minimum wage. You will receive a paycheck every other Friday. TheCareer Centerâ€™sOffice of Student Employment assists students seeking on-campus employment. Some students qualify for the Federal Work-Study Program based on their FAFSA and existing financial aid. Although you are not required to be Federal Work Study-eligible for campus employment, some university positions are primarily for Federal Work Study-eligible students (particularly those at theSteans Center). If you are interested in applying for a campus position that is primarily for Federal Work Study-eligible participants, contact us to determine if you qualify."
