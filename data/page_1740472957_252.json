You can graduate with a State of Illinois license to teach designated subject-area content (listed below). The program also provides you an opportunity to receive a Diploma Year Program Award (IB certification) to teach in International Baccalaureate schools world-wide. As part of the secondary education major, youâ€™ll learn educational theories and effective teaching practices, including how to design and implement curriculum; participate in extensive field experiences at multiple schools, and student-teach for 10 weeks. The secondary education major program, in preparing you to meet Illinois State Licensure requirements, combines education courses from the College of Education with subject-area courses. Through the program, you have two options for becoming a licensed 5th- through 12th-grade teacher: complete the secondary education major degree and a second major in the subject area you intend to teach (double major), or complete as part of your secondary education major degree coursework in the subject area you intend to teach. You can earn either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Education, depending on your subject area.
