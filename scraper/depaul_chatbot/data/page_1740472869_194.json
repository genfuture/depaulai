The calculator evaluates your Student Aid Index (SAI) and estimates a need-based financial aid award. The result is an approximation of what a full-time, undergraduate freshman (with no prior college attendance) could expect to pay to attend DePaul. The Net Price Calculator is NOT designed to estimate costs for transfer students, continuing students, returning undergraduate students, part-time or adult students, international students, or graduate or professional students.If you have questions or need assistance, reviewUnderstand Cost of Attendanceorcontact the Office of Financial Aid. IMPORTANT: The Net Price Calculator is not a financial aid application and does not produce an actual financial aid offer."
