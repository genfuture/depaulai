At DePaul University we believe that maximizing the availability of payment plan options is important in making your college education affordable. Our payment plans offer one or more of the following benefits: The ability to pay your yearly direct costs (tuition, housing fees, food contracts, etc.) in up to 12 installments for the academic year, excluding the summer term, or up to three installments on a term-by-term basis, all for a low enrollment fee. Convenience of having scheduled automated payments deducted from a checking/savings account or a credit/debit card. An extension of the published tuition due dates without penalty for those students whose employer offers a tuition reimbursement program. Can be used in conjunction with your financial aid award. Best of all, our payment plans are interest-free and there are no pre-approval requirements or credit checks. Choose from the four options listed in the Payment Plans Options menu. Alternatively, you can download our currentPayment Optionsbrochure that details the many payment options available to DePaul University students. Please note: Payment Plan Brochure for the next academic year will normally be available by June."
