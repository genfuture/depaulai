Find everything from neighborhood boutiques to tech startups right outside your classroom. It's often hard to tell where the campus ends and the city begins. Lincoln Park Campus Lincoln Park is a residential and retail center, bordered by Lake Michigan and a huge park (think the size of 900 football fields, 14 Portillo's restaurants and an Intelligentsia coffee shop). This is an eclectic and lively neighborhood. Loop Campus The Loop is the city's largest business district. It’s called \"the Loop\" because of the elevated train tracks that circle the area, allowing for easy access not only to classrooms but all that downtown has to offer."
