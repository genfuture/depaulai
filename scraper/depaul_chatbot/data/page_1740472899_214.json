The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, governs the privacy of student records. It regulates access to and the release of education records maintained by all educational institutions, including DePaul. It states: DePaul students must be permitted to inspect their own educational records and request amendments to correct errors (limitations apply). Students have the right to limit the type of information that can be disclosed. DePaul officials are not permitted to disclose personally identifiable information about students nor permit inspection of their records without written consent except as allowed by the Act. Visit theFERPA pagefor complete details."
